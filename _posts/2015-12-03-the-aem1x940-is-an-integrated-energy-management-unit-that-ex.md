The AEM1x940 is an integrated energy management unit that extracts DC power from PV cells or TEGs to supply electronic systems in order to extend their battery life and ultimately get rid of the primary storage element. The AEM1x940 uses an ultra-low-power boost converter to charge storage elements such as Li-Ion batteries, thin film batteries and super or conventional capacitors. The boost converter can operate with input voltages in the range of 100mV up to 2.5V. With the cold-start circuit, it can start operating with empty storage elements at an input voltage as low as 400mV and an input power as low as 3µW. The AEM1x940 can harvest the available input power from 1µW to 50mW with sub-µA operation current. It supplies loads at two configurable supply voltages through highly efficient LDOs. Program pins allow for reducing the number of external components by setting predefined voltage levels for the overcharge or discharge of rechargeable energy storage elements as well as for the high-voltage LDO regulator in typical user cases. However, high versatility can also be obtained by setting those levels with external components.
